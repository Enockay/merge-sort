# merge-sort
Here we are Using the  Merge-sort Algorithm and recursion concept 
Sorting the big un arranged data is the key idea here
if you want to run the code you can clone it to your local machine 
Then Open in the terminals and open That specific directory
Afterwards run Node script.js 
it will simply sort out the data recursively within some millSeconds
